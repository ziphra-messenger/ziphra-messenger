Ziphra Messenger is a military-grade encrypted messaging application, designed to protect all communications through multiple layers of encryption.

It collects no data of any kind and completely removes all metadata.  
No person, organization, or government can access any information.  
Ziphra safeguards both the user’s identity and that of their contacts.  
The app is entirely independent from any other platform, including the phone line itself.

No messages, photos, audio, or videos are ever stored on the device.  
Communication is ephemeral, private, and fully secured.

Anonymity and privacy — guaranteed.
