# Ziphra Messenger 🔐

**Ziphra Messenger** is an inviolable, end-to-end encrypted messaging system, built with military-grade encryption and engineered to guarantee total privacy and digital autonomy.

🚫 No data is ever collected — not now, not later  
🧹 All metadata is stripped before transmission  
📱 Nothing is stored on the device: no messages, no photos, no audio, no videos  
🧾 **No phone number, email, or identity verification is ever required**  
🕵️‍♂️ No person, organization, or government can ever access your information  
🛡️ Both the user's identity and their contacts remain completely hidden  
📶 Fully independent — works without a phone line, SIM card, or any external platform. No dependencies, no intermediaries  

💬 Every conversation is ephemeral, private, and 100% secured  
🔒 The entire system is sealed: there are no backdoors, no trackers, and no exceptions

📖 **Ziphra is 100% open source**, licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)**.  
Anyone can inspect, audit, and improve the code — total transparency, no hidden logic.

Ziphra is not just secure — it is **absolutely anonymous, untraceable, and unbreakable**.

> Designed for those who demand true digital freedom.  
> Created to protect what others don't: your silence, your absence, your right to vanish.
